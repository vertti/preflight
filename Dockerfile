# A scratch image has no CA bundle, and Go's TLS verification has nowhere else
# to look, so every `preflight http https://...` fails with "certificate signed
# by unknown authority". Alpine's bundle is ~220KB and is already a maintained
# artifact, so take it rather than shipping certificates from this repo.
